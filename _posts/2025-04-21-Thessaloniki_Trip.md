# Thessaloniki Trip

## Departure

Thanks to the people we met during our city tour, we discovered the existence of a student organization at our school called **ESN**. This association regularly organizes trips at affordable prices, so we signed up for a journey to Thessaloniki.

This city is located in the north of Greece, and the bus ride took about 7 hours. We had to wake up very early because the bus was leaving at 6:30 AM — tough, but the excitement of traveling made us forget the fatigue. We spent most of the ride DJing since the bus speakers were awful — luckily, I brought my own speaker!

## Arrival in Thessaloniki

Once we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait a bit before receiving our room keys and dropping off our luggage. We had a room for four, with two bunk beds — Tim, Lubin, Corentin, and I. Upon arrival, we were handed a schedule for the next four days, including planned activities and parties. We had some free time before heading to the "Greek Night" at 8:30 PM, so we decided to explore the city a little!

When it was time for the "Greek Night," we were welcomed into a restaurant where we enjoyed traditional Greek dishes — the famous Greek salad as a starter and Souvlaki with potatoes. It was delicious! The best part? Unlimited wine...

## Day 2

The second day started a bit rough after the big party the night before… For breakfast, ESN had prepared something with cheese, which was quite horrible to eat so early, but we laughed a lot about it! Then it was already time to hop on the bus for our next destination: the **Thermal Baths** — which, without knowing it yet, would turn out to be my favorite activity of the entire trip.

After around 4 hours of driving, we arrived at a beautiful spot with small local shops. As we walked up, we discovered the **Thermal Baths**.

Since the main pool was a bit crowded, Tim, Lubin, and I found a spot where hot water was flowing over some rocks — it was incredibly relaxing.

Back at the hotel, we had some free time, so we had a little pre-party with new friends we met during the trip — Gerhrud (from Estonia) and Marina (from Portugal). We played cards, chatted, and laughed a lot before heading out to the club for the evening. We danced, sang, and had fun — though being crammed in with so many people was quite tiring.

## Day 3

Waking up was even harder on the third day. After two intense days filled with activities and parties, everyone was clearly exhausted — it was funny to see everyone’s sleepy faces in the morning. Today's plan was a **City Tour**. We started by visiting a church.

As the tour continued, Tim and I were both super tired and starving, so we left the group to grab something to eat. Of course, we couldn’t resist our guilty pleasure in Greece: **Gyros**!

Completely exhausted, we decided to return to the hotel and spend a quiet afternoon resting.

In the evening, we grabbed some pizza before heading to the **Game Night**. It was held on the hotel rooftop and featured games like beer pong. The atmosphere was great — we had an amazing time!

## Last Day

The next day, we were headed to **Vergina** before returning to Athens. There, we visited a museum that was almost entirely dark — which made the artifacts stand out beautifully thanks to clever lighting.

After the visit, we enjoyed the park and relaxed in the sun on a grassy spot before getting back on the bus and heading back to Athens!
