## Thessaloniki Trip (Part 1)

ESN is a group of students who organize and propose trips. Among the various trips on offer, Corentin, Lubin, Alex and I chose to sign up for the Thessaloniki Trip; Thessaloniki, which is the second largest city after Athens. The trip cost 173 euros per person and lasted 4 days, from 13 March to 16 March.

On the first day, we started our adventure very early in the morning. Waking up at 5am wasn't easy, but we were happy to get going. We met up at Metaxourgeio at 6.30am, and by 7am we were finally on our way. During the journey, we were treated to some music, but the sound from the bus speakers was horrible. Luckily, Alex had brought along his big speaker, and we played DJ until we arrived. After a long journey, we arrived in Thessaloniki at around 4pm. We checked into our hotel rooms and, after dropping off our stuff, we were ready to explore. At 5pm, we had a bit of free time. We decided to go for a walk and take a few photos. The city is really beautiful, with lots of little cafés and shops. In the evening, at 8.30pm, we went to a Greek Night in a local restaurant. It was so good! We ate Greek food and enjoyed an open bar. We thought about going clubbing afterwards, but the prices were a bit too high, so we finally decided to go back to the hotel. It was just as well, because it was late and there were still several days to go.

The next day started with breakfast at 9.30am. We were all a bit tired, but we were motivated for what lay ahead. At 11am, we set off for the Thermal Baths. It really was the best! The hot water had formed natural “seats”, and we were able to relax in the sun. We spent hours laughing and enjoying the water.

After that, we headed back to the hotel at 5pm. In the evening, we had a bit of free time before meeting up for a pre-drink at 9pm. We had a good laugh with our friends and played some card games, before going out clubbing at 11.30pm. We danced for a long time and laughed a lot, so it was a great evening where we met a lot of new people.
