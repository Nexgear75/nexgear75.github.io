# 🇬🇷 From the Greek Islands to Bratislava 🇸🇰
## A Journey of Friendship, Delays, and Surprises

After our different **escapades through the Greek islands**, we decided it was time to reconnect with our friends from **ESAIP** — so we set our sights on **Bratislava**!  
This trip had been planned for quite a while, and it was finally the perfect opportunity to reunite with our fellow Erasmus friends from **Bratislava, Croatia, and Vilnius**, and to **share some quality time together**.

## The (Mis)Adventure Begins

We flew out from **Athens Airport** to **Vienna**, then planned to take a bus to Bratislava. Unfortunately, our flight was delayed by about **30 minutes**, which made us **hope until the last minute** that we’d catch our bus… but no. We saw it **drive away right in front of us**.  
So, we had to **buy new tickets** and **wait** for the next one to arrive. Not the best start — but part of the adventure!

## 🏨 Settling In

We booked a small **hotel close to our friends**, where we dropped off our bags and quickly headed out to **meet up** with everyone.

## 🌳 Reunions in the Park

We met up with **Laurent Fauveau** in a park — and it felt **so good to see our friends again**, after so long apart!  
He gave us a quick tour of the area before we headed to **Mladá Garda**, where many of them were staying.

To my surprise, the place was **huge**, but the **rooms were quite small**, and everyone was **spread out across several floors**.  
Even more surprising: the kitchens were **shared** — something I find **a bit demotivating** when it comes to cooking proper meals.

## 🍻 A Night Underground

Later that evening, we finally reunited with **the whole group**, and we all went out to a **bar located in a cave** — an unforgettable place, full of laughs and great vibes.

## 👚 Style Challenge in the City

The next day, we kicked things off with a fun stop at a **thrift store**.  
**Colin and Chloë** challenged each other to create an outfit for one another — and here’s the result…

We then spent the rest of the day **exploring the city**, soaking in its **beautiful viewpoints** and **architectural gems**.  
Every corner had something special to offer.
