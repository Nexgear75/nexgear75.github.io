## Few days with my family

I was lucky enough that my family was able to visit me for 5 days and I'm going to tell you about our program.

It started on Wednesday the 9th, when they left Angers at 7.30am. They arrived at Orly airport at 10am to drop off the car. Check-in took place at 10.45am, and by 12.45pm they were finally on the plane. After a few hoursâ€™ flight, they landed in Athens at 8.40pm. At around 9.15pm, they took the X95 bus to Syntagma, a journey of about an hour. I met them there and we walked together to their Airbnb. 

The next day, Thursday 10, we started our day with a visit to the historic Plaka district, located at the foot of the Acropolis. My family really liked this place, with its narrow streets and colorful houses. For lunch, we chose the Aerides restaurant, where we tried typical Greek dishes. In the afternoon, we visited the Panathenaic Stadium before watching the changing of the guard at 6pm in Syntagma Square. The day ended with dinner in the Anafiotika district.

On Friday 11th, we flew to Santorini. After leaving our accommodation at 7am, we took the metro to the airport. I was happy to have already made the journey so that I could guide my family more serenely. By 11am, we were already on the famous island of Santorini. We spent time walking in the village and we saw a lot of cats (see photo below).
