# Bratislava – Part Two

## A Day of Endurance and Determination

The next day was all about a major event: **Laurent and Chloé’s marathon and half-marathon!**  
They had been training for months, with one clear goal in mind—performance. Laurent aimed to complete the 42 km marathon in around **3 hours and 30 minutes**, while Chloé set her sights on running the 21 km half-marathon in under **2 hours**.

So I woke up early to be at the starting line by 8 a.m., joined by Adeline and Chaimaa.  
It was **freezing**, but nothing could stop us from being there to cheer them on and support them through this incredible challenge.

## Playing the Support Crew

Our job wasn’t just to clap from the sidelines—we had a mission:  
**strategically position ourselves along the course** to provide water and snacks to our two runners.  
Every few kilometers, we had to be in the right place at the right time to make sure they were well-fueled and supported.

After Chloé crossed the finish line with an impressive time, we shifted our attention to Laurent.  
His race had taken a difficult turn. He began to **struggle with cramps**, which forced him to slow down dramatically. His body was clearly reaching its limit.

What made things harder was that most participants were only doing the half-marathon. So after three hours, the crowds disappeared—**no more runners, no more spectators**—which made it mentally tough for those still pushing through.

Seeing Laurent in distress, I decided to **run the final 6 kilometers** by his side to keep him going.

Soon after, Tim joined us for the last 3 kilometers, giving Laurent one last boost of motivation.

## Victory in Finishing

Laurent didn’t quite hit his target time, but that wasn’t what mattered anymore.  
The real achievement was simply **finishing a marathon**—a feat in itself and something to be proud of.

The rest of the day was spent **recovering, resting, and just enjoying the calm after the storm**.

## A Picnic in the Park

The following day, we all gathered in a **park on the outskirts of the city** for a relaxing picnic.

We wandered through the park afterward, laughing, talking, and making the most of our time together.

## One Last Night Out

That evening, we regrouped once more—this time in a bar that, oddly enough, was **completely empty except for us**.  
It turned out to be perfect. The bar had a hidden **underground room full of games**, and we spent hours having fun, playing pool, and just enjoying the moment.

## Time to Say Goodbye

The next day came all too quickly—it was time to fly back to Greece.  
Before heading to the airport, we shared one last coffee together, a quiet moment to **say goodbye and reflect** on an unforgettable experience.
