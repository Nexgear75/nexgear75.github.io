## Trip to Paros

In this article, I'm going to tell you about our weekend in Paros ! On 22 March, we woke up at 5am after just three hours' sleep. At 7.30am, we boarded the ferry and after a long four-hour journey, we finally arrived in Paros at around 11.30am.

As soon as we arrived on the island, we began exploring the village. The narrow-cobbled streets and typical white houses with blue shutters were magnificent. We were very hungry, so we stopped for Gyros. At 1.45pm, we started heading for our Airbnb, but once we got there, we couldn't find the apartment because we didn't have the exact address. On the islands, they don't always have an address, so we tried to work it out using the PIN point on the app. After about 10 minutes of searching, we finally found our apartment. It was lovely, with a rooftop offering a nice view.

Once we had dropped off our stuff, we got ready to go to the beach, but then we realized with Alex that we had forgotten our volleyball ! Fortunately, as we passed a shop, Lucie decided to buy one. Our afternoon was saved and we spent hours on the beach playing volleyball, and some of us even went for a swim.
In the evening, we had the classic pasta and cheese meal, and the evening continued with games and discussions.

The next day, March 23, we left our Airbnb at 10am. We spent time on the terrace of a bakery. Then we took the bus to another village. We wandered around a bit before looking for a restaurant.

Around 1pm, we found a restaurant by the water. To fit in with the clich√©s, the three girls had a Greek salad and the three guys had chips with fish. In the afternoon, we continued to explore the village and wander around the rocks. At 5pm, we played cards on the beach while we waited for our ferry. At 6.30pm, we decided we had time to eat at the restaurant before leaving. At 6.45pm, seeing that we wouldn't have time, we decided to get takeaway.

We ordered our food, but by 7pm there were still three people waiting to get their order, and I was the last one waiting for my burger. 7.10pm ; still nothing. At 7.10pm, I finally got my burger and it was time to sprint to the ferry !

We underestimated the distance, and by 7.15pm we were 100 meters from the boat, seeing the boarding gate closed. Fortunately, the car ramp was still open. We got in just in time, and the ferry left 30 seconds afterwards. We took a breath of fresh air at the back, realizing that we had almost spent another night on the island.

In the end, we arrived at the port of Piraeus at 11.15pm, and by midnight we were back at the apartment, exhausted but super happy with our weekend in Paros !
