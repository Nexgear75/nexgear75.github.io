## Thessaloniki Trip (Part 2)

On 15 March, we had breakfast again at 9.30am. It was funny to see all the faces a bit tired, but we were off again for another day. At 11.30am, we set off on a tour of the city. The guide was really nice and told us lots of stories about Thessaloniki. But by midday we were really hungry, so we decided to go and eat gyros in a little restaurant. It was so good! After eating well, we headed back to the hotel for an afternoon of chill. We just hung out, played games and enjoyed our time together. 

In the evening, the guys were in the mood for pizza so we decided to go and eat at a pizzeria not far from the hotel at around 7.30pm. We then joined the game night, which had been going on for 30 minutes. We played beer pong and had a talent contest. It was hilarious! I even ended up in the ESN story because I made the sound of the owl with my hands. I don't know if it was because they thought it was really funny or if the other talents were even lamer than that one, but it made me laugh.

On our last day, 16 March, we had breakfast at 8am. We left the hotel at 9.30am and set off for Vergina, where there is a museum and an eating area. We arrived at 11am and started to visit the museum, but I have to say that I've never seen a museum with so little lighting. It was a bit like a game of hide-and-seek in the dark, and we found it hard to see certain things. After the visit, we took a lunch break before getting back on the road to Athens. 

We left at 1pm and, after a few hours on the road, not without music, we finally arrived in Athens at 8pm. We were all tired so Alex and I made a quick trip back to the flat (luckily the arrival point wasn't too far from our house) and went to bed very quickly. We were very happy to have spent four days in Thessaloniki. We have a lot of good memories of this trip so we were happy with our choice of trip.
