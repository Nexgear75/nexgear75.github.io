# Arrival in Athens

## Accommodation

To begin with, we left Nantes airport at 6 AM and had to endure a long layover in Amsterdam before finally making our way to Athens. Once we arrived, we still had an hour of public transport ahead of us to reach the city center!

Our first real interaction in English was with the son of our landlord, who was very friendly! He explained a few things about how the apartment works, notably that the water is heated by solar panels. Therefore, in winter, we need to manually turn on the boiler if we want the luxury of a hot shower! 

However, what surprised us the most was the toilets... In Greece, and not just in our apartment, you don’t flush toilet paper down the bowl but instead dispose of it in a bin next to the toilet. At first, it felt really strange since we weren’t used to it, but now it’s no longer an issue. 

## Classes

We quickly noticed some differences from France, particularly the organization, which we now jokingly call the "Greek organization" with a resigned tone... 

We were supposed to start our classes on February 24th. I say "supposed to" because, on the evening of the 22nd, we learned that the start date was postponed to the following week... One week later, we finally thought we were about to attend our first Erasmus class, but to our surprise, the professor was speaking in Greek... It turned out that the Erasmus student lists were still not ready, meaning there was no point in us being in class yet. So, we only stayed for 20 minutes in our so-called "first class."

We also learned that to get information, schedules, and details about when and where we were supposed to be, we had to ask the professors directly, which is far from convenient... Fortunately, most of our classes are project-based, which means we learn in a more self-taught manner. 

## Meeting People

Since we didn’t have classes for quite some time, we took the opportunity to explore the surroundings and meet new people.

ESN, a student association at the university, organized a whole week of daily activities—perfect for meeting people! We joined a "city tour," where we met plenty of young Erasmus students from all over Europe. To our surprise, there were a lot of French students, but also Germans, Polish, Hungarians, Estonians, and many more.

That same evening, after these first encounters, we ended up spending time with a French girl and a Polish girl who kindly invited us to continue the night together. The evening lasted until 4 AM…

We had to speak English non-stop so that everyone could understand. I must admit, it wasn’t easy at first while my brain was adjusting to another language, but I managed to make myself understood—even though it wasn’t a given at the start!
