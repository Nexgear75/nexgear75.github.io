PAROS

It had been some time since our group of friends started talking about traveling to the islands around Athens. Eventually, we ended up organizing a trip to the island of Paros!

We had to book our ferry to get there, and thanks to a little trick, we managed to travel for free, significantly reducing the cost of our trip!

When we arrived, the first thing that stood out compared to Athens was the iconic Greek architecture with its distinctive white buildings!

Our apartment was not available before 2 pm, so we started exploring the surroundings!

As you can see, everything is white—both the buildings and the ground, and it’s very beautiful to see. There are also many charming little alleys to explore, filled with small shops that were mostly closed as it wasn't the tourist season yet!

In Greece, it’s quite common to encounter wild animals! While cats are the most frequent sight, sometimes we have some rather amusing surprises!

Later, we had a meal and finally got into our apartment, then went out again to see more. Here’s the stunning view from our apartment rooftop!

The next day, we took a bus to the most popular town in Paros: Naoussa. After walking a lot, we stopped at a small local restaurant with a lovely view of the port!

We enjoyed freshly caught local fish and delicious Greek salad.

Afterward, we continued towards the small fort visible from the restaurant to see what was there, and we had a beautiful view of part of the city!

We then headed in the direction of a church to continue exploring the city and came across some beautiful spots.

Before returning to the first town where the port is, we walked along the coast and found a rather rocky but beautiful spot where Tim and I had fun running! One of our friends even had the courage to swim!

It was unfortunately time for our little group to head back before catching our return ferry. We spent our last moments on the beach playing cards while watching the sunset.

For a little final anecdote, before taking our 4-hour return ferry, we thought we’d eat just before, but we misjudged the timing. Tim and I ended up running to catch the ferry at the last minute, with our food in hand. Just as we boarded, the boat left the port. Exhausted but happy, we returned to Athens with our meal...
