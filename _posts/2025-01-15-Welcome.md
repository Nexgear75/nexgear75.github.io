# Welcome to Athens

### Behaviour

Greek people are often described as **warm**, **hospitable**, and **laid-back**. They value **personal relationships** deeply and are known for their generosity and friendliness, especially **towards guests and visitors**. Conversations can be animated, with a lot of **gestures and expressions**. In contrast, while the French are also warm and welcoming, their interactions may initially seem more **reserved** or **formal**, particularly with **strangers**.

In Greece, punctuality is often seen more **flexibly**, and there’s a **relaxed approach** to time compared to the French, who tend to value **punctuality**, especially in professional or formal settings. Greeks also have a strong **sense of community**, and socializing in **public spaces** like squares or cafés is a vital part of their daily life.

### Gastony habits

Meals are often a **communal experience**, and sharing dishes is common. Greeks enjoy leisurely meals that can last for **hours**, accompanied by conversation and often some wine or **ouzo** (a traditional anise-flavored spirit).

#### **Popular Greek dishes include:**

**Souvlaki and Gyros**: Popular street foods featuring grilled meat, pita bread, and fresh vegetables.

Whitout **knowing it** we choose the same apartment as the previous student who went to Athens.

We are at **44 minutes** far from our University. It's quite long but we know from previous students that we don't have much **class time**, so it's not a real problem for us.
