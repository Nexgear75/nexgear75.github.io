## Arrival in Athens, integration week and 'start of the school'

I left with Alex on the night of 18 to 19 February by car to Nantes airport, where we took our first plane to Amsterdam at around 6am. Once we arrived, we had to wait 4 hours before leaving for Greece. We arrived at Athens airport at around 6pm and then took a shuttle bus to our flat in the centre of Athens. Being rather out of the way, we didn't get to our flat until around 7pm, when the owner's son showed us round and we signed the contract.

As I hadn't managed to sleep on the plane or at any time during the day, I didn't sleep for two days and arrived exhausted. So I spent the next day recuperating, and then we did a bit of shopping. 

As the start of the school year on 24 February had been postponed to the Tuesday of the following week, we had an integration week. We took part in a City Tour near the Acropolis, where we met lots of students. I spoke to some students who had been in Greece since September, and they gave me a lot of information, both about the university and about life in Athens in general.

During the week, I took the opportunity to look for a gym with Alex, discover the area and, of course, go to a few parties where we met other students. We got our bearings and took care of a number of administrative formalities, such as obtaining a transport card, a student card and so on.

On the first day of term, we went to the university for 11am, but what a surprise it was to hear the professor start speaking in Greek. It was only after a while that one of us raised our hand to ask what was going on. The teacher replied, not without surprise, that the course was for Greek students. In short, we had just witnessed Greek organisation once again; the university had not warned us of anything and we had come for nothing. We later learned that the teachers had not yet received the list of Erasmus students and that they would be contacting us by e-mail shortly. In short, our supposed start of courses had once again been postponed to an unknown date. So we took the opportunity to visit the university before heading home.

In conclusion, everything went well overall, both the journey and the arrival, but there was a major lack of organisation and anticipation on the part of the university.
